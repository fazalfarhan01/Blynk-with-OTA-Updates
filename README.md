# IoT based home control and automation
This project mainly relies on Blynk Server running at ftm.ddns.net (a custom Blynk Server Running on a Raspberry Pi), it's publicly available but protected authentication and SSL.

A custom app created on Kodular is also used for fast opening when comparted to the default Blynk app on Android. (10x faster).
